# Building Accessible Web Applications

Web accessibility is not just a legal requirementâ€”it's a moral imperative. Creating inclusive digital experiences benefits everyone and opens your applications to a broader audience.

## Why Accessibility Matters

- **Inclusive Design**: Ensures everyone can use your application
- **Legal Compliance**: Meets ADA and WCAG standards
- **Better UX**: Improves usability for all users
- **SEO Benefits**: Accessible markup helps search engines

## Key Principles

### 1. Semantic HTML
Use proper HTML elements for their intended purpose:

```html
<button type="button">Click me</button>
<nav aria-label="Main navigation">...</nav>
<main>...</main>
```

### 2. Keyboard Navigation
Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible:

- Logical tab order
- Visible focus indicators
- Skip links for main content

### 3. Screen Reader Support
Provide meaningful labels and descriptions:

```html
<img src="chart.png" alt="Sales increased 25% from Q1 to Q2" />
<label for="email">Email Address</label>
<input id="email" type="email" required />
```

## Testing Your Application

- Use automated testing tools like axe-core
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Navigate using only the keyboard
- Check color contrast ratios

## Conclusion

Building accessible web applications is an ongoing process that requires awareness, planning, and testing. Start with the basics and gradually improve your accessibility practices.
