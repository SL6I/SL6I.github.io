# JavaScript Performance Optimization

Performance is crucial for user experience. Slow JavaScript can make even the most beautiful application feel sluggish and unresponsive.

## Common Performance Bottlenecks

### 1. DOM Manipulation
- Minimize direct DOM access
- Batch DOM updates
- Use document fragments for multiple insertions

### 2. Memory Leaks
- Remove event listeners when no longer needed
- Clear intervals and timeouts
- Be cautious with closures

### 3. Inefficient Loops
- Use appropriate loop types for the task
- Avoid nested loops when possible
- Consider using map, filter, reduce for functional approaches

## Optimization Techniques

### Code Splitting
Break your code into smaller chunks:
```javascript
// Dynamic imports
const module = await import('./heavy-module.js');
```

### Lazy Loading
Load resources only when needed:
```javascript
// Intersection Observer for lazy loading
const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
  entries.forEach(entry => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      loadContent(entry.target);
    }
  });
});
```

### Debouncing and Throttling
Control function execution frequency:
```javascript
// Debounce function
function debounce(func, wait) {
  let timeout;
  return function executedFunction(...args) {
    const later = () => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
      func(...args);
    };
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(later, wait);
  };
}
```

## Measuring Performance

Use built-in browser tools:
- Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- Lighthouse audits
- Web Vitals metrics

## Best Practices

1. **Profile Before Optimizing**: Measure to identify real bottlenecks
2. **Start with the Biggest Impact**: Focus on changes that matter most
3. **Test on Real Devices**: Desktop performance â‰  mobile performance
4. **Monitor Continuously**: Performance can degrade over time

Remember, premature optimization is the root of all evil, but ignoring performance entirely is just as problematic.
